# Barleymap standalone, INSTALL

# You should have downloaded a .tar.gz file (eg.: barleymap_popseq.tar.gz)
# Then you have uncompressed it into a directory, for example:

mkdir apps;
cd apps;
tar -zxf barleymap_popseq.tar.gz # It will create a barleymap_popseq directory inside apps/

# Barleymap is mostly written in Python
# Thus, you must make the barleymap code available to the python path with
# export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/$app_path/; for example:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/apps/barleymap_popseq/

# Then you should read "Configuration" on README file
# to configure all the resources that barleymap needs
# to work properly.
