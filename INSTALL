# Carlos P Cantalapiedra 20131227 (updated 20140318)
# Barleymap standalone, INSTALL

# You should have downloaded a .tar.gz file (eg.: barleymap.tar.gz)
# Then you have uncompressed it into a directory, for example:

mkdir apps;
cd apps;
tar -zxf barleymap.tar.gz # It will create a barleymap directory inside apps/

# Barleymap is mostly written in Python
# Thus, you must make the barleymap code available to the python path with
# export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/$app_path/; for example:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/apps/barleymap/

# Note that to run barleymap you also need the barleymapcore libraries
# which you should make visible also

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"barleymapcore_PATH"

# Then you should read "Configuration" on README file
# to configure all the resources that barleymap needs
# to work properly.
