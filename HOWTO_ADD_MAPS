# HOWTO_ADD_MAPS in Barleymap standalone application

# 1) Create a directory with MAP_ID under maps/ directory
# Example:
maps/newmap

# 2) Add the map data to the new directory.
# Data must have target identifier and map position in three or four
# fields (tab separated) depending if the map has centimorgan and/or
# basepairs information.
# The format would be:
# identifier    chromosome    (centimorgan_position)    (basepairs_position)
#
# The name of the file must follow the pattern (without extension):
MAP_ID.DATABASE_ID

# where MAP_ID is the name used in step 1)
# and DATABASE_ID the one used in HOWTO_ADD_DATABASES

# Examples of files for 2 maps, one of them with data for 2 databases:

maps/newmap/newmap.newdb
maps/anothermap/anothermap.newdb
maps/anothermap/anothermap.anotherdb

# 3) Add a line in conf/maps.conf, with six space-separated fields.
#       The first field is the name that will be shown for that Map.
#       The second field is the MAP_ID used in step 1)
#       The third field indicates if centimorgan position is available (cm_true)
#           or not (cm_false) for this map.
#       The fourth field indicates if basepairs position is available (bp_true)
#           or not (bp_false) for this map
#       The fifth field can have "genetic" or "physical" values. The "physical" value
#           should only be applied for maps with "bp_true". In this case, if "genetic"
#           the map position shown will be that of the target of the alignment.
#           If "physical", the map position shown will be the sum of the target of the
#           alignment plus the local position of the alignment.
#       The sixth field has a DATABASE_ID or a comma-separated list of DATABASE_IDs
#           for which data is available for this map.

#       Examples:

My_New_Map newmap cm_false bp_true genetic newdb
AnotherMap anothermap cm_true bp_false genetic newdb,anotherdb
PhysicalMap physmap cm_true bp_true physical newdb,anotherdb,thirddb

# 4) If correctly configured, the new maps should be listed under "MAPS" section in "Configured data"
# when running bmaux_check_config auxiliar script.
