## These are little samples (50 sequences) from bigger barley databases
## so that the final user can use them to test the application.

## You should first uncompress the fasta files:
tar -zxf fasta_samples.tar.gz

## Please execute the commands in blast_dbs.sh and gmap_dbs.sh
## to create the test databases

## You could use "def_paths.conf" instead of conf/paths.conf
## to test these databases. Just do something to similar to:
mv ../../conf/paths.conf ../../conf/paths.conf_old;
cp def_paths.conf ../../conf/paths.conf;
