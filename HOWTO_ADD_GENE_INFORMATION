# Carlos P Cantalapiedra 20131227 (updated 20140318)
# HOWTO_ADD_GENE_INFORMATION in Barleymap standalone application

# A) Add genes data to genes/ directory.

# The file must have "_genes.tab" extension and follow the pattern:
MAP_ID_genes.tab

# where MAP_ID is the name used in HOWTO_ADD_MAPS

# The format of the file is tab separated, with the fields:
Gene_ID HC/LC   MAP_ID    chromosome  cM_position bp_position

# HC/LC (High or Low Confidence) can be used if the gene confidence is known.
# bp_position should be filled with "-" if the map has no bp_position
# (bp_false in maps/maps.conf, see HOWTO_ADD_MAPS).

# B) Annotation data of genes.

# If you want to add or update annotation information
# note that Barleymap uses a single file located under annot/ directory.
# You can edit such file or add another file and change the conf/paths.conf
# "annot_filename" row to point to the new file.
# REMEMBER that only the file in the "annot_filename" row will be used.
#
# The format of the annotation file should use tab separated fields, and
# barleymap will use only the following ones (the rest can be filled with any
# symbol, "-" for example, or left blank)

Gene_ID in the first field
PFAM_DATABASE in the fourth field (not only PFAM databases, can be others, like PANTHER, ...)
PFAM identifier in the fifth field (not only PFAM identifers, can be others, like PANTHER, ...)
InterPro identifier in the tenth field
Human readable description in eleventh field
GeneOntology identifier in twelfth field
